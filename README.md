# Exploring food security data using SQL and Tableau
A brief exploration of food insecurity data and how it relates to various factors, such as management of water services, sanitation access and government spending.

# Description of what 'moderate to severe food insecurity' means:
The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity is an estimate of the percentage of people in the population who live in households classified as moderately or severely food insecure. The assessment is conducted using data collected with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale or a compatible experience-based food security measurement questionnaire (such as the HFSSM). The probability to be food insecure is estimated using the one-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model (the Rasch model) and thresholds for classification are made cross country comparable by calibrating the metrics obtained in each country against the FIES global reference scale, maintained by FAO. The threshold to classify "moderate or severe" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item "having to eat less" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as moderately or severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to low quality diets and might have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat because of a lack of money or other resources. It is an indicator of lack of food access.


# Description of what 'political stability and absence of violence/terrorism (index)' means:
Political stability and absence of violence measures perceptions of the likelihood that thegovernment will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, includingpolitically-motivated violence and terrorism.
